\chapter*{Executive Summary}
It is farley known that the subject of computer security is a known issue the development of application by industries.
This issue is manly due to the fact that most of the development are side product of industries used to fulfil a 
technical need.
\newline This problematic is all the more significant when industries try to optimize their information system 
infrastructure by using containerized technologies and Cloud Computing at the same time.

In this thesis, we will try to find solutions and means to solve this ever-growing issue of securing the development and
deployment pipeline o containerized application. Then, after a careful selection, we will implement some of these solutions
on different parts of the pipeline and evaluate them.
\newline This work will also demonstrate the need of cooperation between security, architecture, infrastructure and 
development teams to achieve this goal.

The conclusion will follow with a first return of experience  of the implemented solution and associated results.
This par will include booth parts of  problematic.

Finally, we will discuss the future of the project and the possible tasks the company may need to accomplish to fulfil
its goal, more specifically on the training aspect.
